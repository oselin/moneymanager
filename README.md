# moneymanager


First attempt to create a webapp service which allows you to track incoming and outcoming money/bills/savings, uploading data in the cloud. The main goal is generate a monthly PDF with 30-days-records.

Because I don't have any server to run this service, i made a static webpage, hosting here on Github (oselin.github.io/moneymanager) and uploading datas in a google cloud server.
